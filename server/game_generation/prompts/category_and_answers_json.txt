suggest {num_categories:.0f} randomly selected specific trivia categories. Also create a title that describes the category and/or the topic. If it is possible to do so without altering the meaning of the title, have the title be one of an alliteration, rhyme or pun. 

Lastly, come up with {num_answers:.0f} trivia answers per category. All answers should be from the trivia category you've decided upon. Trivia answers should not contain any extra information (no parentheses). Ensure that all answers in a category are unique. Order the answers in increasing difficulty, where answers further along are less common. It should be possible to uniquely describe the answer in a clue.

Return your answer as a list of dictionary objects. Each object contains two keys: 'Title' and 'Answers', containing the title of a category and the associated answers respectively.
