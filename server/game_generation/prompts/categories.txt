suggest {num:.0f} specific trivia categories. Next create a topic which should be a subsection of the category (Note the topic should be singular). Lastly create a title that describes the category and/or the topic. If it is possible to do so without altering the meaning of the title, have the title be one of an alliteration, rhyme or pun.  

Your reply must only consist of one line for every category! Ensure there are no commas in the title chosen. You must only reply strictly using the following template for all {num:.0f} categories and nothing else:
- <topic>, <category>, <title>
