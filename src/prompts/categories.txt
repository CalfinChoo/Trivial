suggest {num:.0f} plural trivia categories. Lastly create a title for the category. The title should be relevant to the category. If possible use an alliteration, rhyme or a pun to make the title. Singular is the singular form of the plural category. 

Your reply must only consist of one line for every category! You must only reply strictly using the following template for all {num:.0f} categories and nothing else:
- <singular>, <plural>, <title>
